# Steam-Group-Scraper
Steam-Group-Scraper
This is my first smaller project, probably its not the best code for this job, but atleast its working!
Bugs i couldn't fix :
    - It doesn't scraper the groups in order to the txt. (im pretty sure its because of threading.)
    
    
HOW TO USE?:

You will need to install
futures
BeautifulSoup
threading

When you run the py file it will ask you for a starting group id and an ending one, then for threads i recommend using 15-30 (up to you)

The python program will create a txt file for you, and it will scrape the groups into that txt file.
